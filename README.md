# Topic Modeling using Combination BERTopic and IndoSBERT
A Text Mining project by <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/nur-huda-riyantoni">Nur Huda Riyantoni</a> submitted to fulfill one of the requirements to obtain a Bachelor of Computer Science (S.Kom) degree in the Information Systems study program <a href="https://uinsa.ac.id/fst"> Islamic University of Sunan Ampel </a>. This project use BERTopic framework from <a href="https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic"> Maarten Grootendorst </a> and IndSBERT-large Embeddings from <a href="https://huggingface.co/denaya/indoSBERT-large"> Denaya </a>

# Goals
<ul>
  <li>Using IndoSBERT in embeddings stage of BERTopic Framework</li>
  <li>To know topic in thesis information system study program </li>
</ul>

# The Dataset 
In this project, the dataset was collected by web scrapping using python. The data collected came from the digital library web of each PTKIN that has an information system study program. The data taken is the year data and thesis abstracts from 2019 to 2023 (the last 5 years) from Information Systems students. 

# Scenarios Project 
The project was carried out with several scenarios for UMAP, HDBSCAN and CountVectorizer parameters. Each scenario was then evaluated using topic coherence and topic diversity metrics.
